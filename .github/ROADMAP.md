## Medium-Term (UX & Features)

- [ ] **Playlist Management**: Allow loading a folder of tracks or multiple files at once.
- [ ] **Visual Feedback**: accurate LED states for Play/Pause/Cue buttons.
- [ ] **Jog Wheel**: Implement pitch bend functionality via the jog wheel (if UI permits).

## Long-Term (Advanced)
- [ ] **MIDI Support**: Investigate Web MIDI API to allow hardware controllers to drive the UI.
