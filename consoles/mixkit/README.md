### Key Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Load Local Audio** | Browse and select common audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, etc.) from your computer for instant playback. |
| **MP3 Metadata Display** | Shows track title, artist, and album art from the file's ID3 tags. |
| **Deck Controls** | Play, pause, stop, loop (repeat), and crossfade between tracks. |
| **Manual Tempo Control** | Adjust playback speed by +/- 8% for manual beatmatching. |
| **Visual Feedback** | Progress bar, elapsed/total time, and a waveform preview for each deck. |
| **Master Spectrum Analyzer** | Provides a real-time visualization of the master output's frequency spectrum. |

### How It Works

1. **Load the App**  
   - Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

2. **Add Tracks**  
   - Click “Browse” on a deck to select an audio file from your hard drive.

3. **Mix & Play**  
   - Use the deck controls for each track. The app keeps a single `AudioContext` and routes audio through gain nodes, enabling smooth volume changes and crossfades.

4. **Save Your Session**  
   - Click “Export” → choose a name → save the JSON file. Load it later with “Import”.
